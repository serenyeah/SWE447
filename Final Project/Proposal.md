# Overview

I am going to make an interactive representation of objects and symbols formed from the 'flower of life'. Initially, all the stages and drawings will loop through in an animation. Users are given the option to click on what render they would like to see and the geometry would be rendered for them. They can also set it back to looping through them all if they want to.
