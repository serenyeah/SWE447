# Overview

I am going to make an interactive representation of objects and symbols formed from the 'flower of life'. Initially, all the stages and drawings will loop through in an animation. Users are given the option to click on what render they would like to see and the geometry would be rendered for them. They can also set it back to looping through them all if they want to. There are 10 shapes including the 'flower of life'. Underneath the gif/loop/image, will be the names of all available images to switch to and from. My stretch goal is to render the shapes in a 3D space, and rotate them in a loop.


# Five Steps

Week 1: Research all of the shapes and symbols found in the "Flower of Life". Research the different ways to impliment my project idea.

Week 2: Render the "flower of life". Position it in the middle of the screen.

Week 3: Render all of the other shapes(9) ontop of the 'flower of life'(faded).

Week 4: Animate the shapes into a comprehensive gif.

Week 5: (Stretch Goal) Render the shapes in 3D. Rotate them in place.



# Implimentation

I will create a web-based application based on what I have learned in class and anything that I can find online that will help me in realizing my goal.
